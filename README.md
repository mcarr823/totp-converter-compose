# TOTP JSON Converter

This program converts JSON files between a few different 2FA providers' formats.

The intended use for this program is to move from one 2FA provider to another by exporting your tokens from one provider and converting them into a different format.

This app is the Android port of the [self-hosted web version](https://github.com/mcarr823/totp-json-converter).

* This app is a work-in-progress and is not yet functional.
